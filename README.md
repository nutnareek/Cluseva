# Cluseva
Cluseva is A C# library for cluster performance evaluation which contains several methods to evaluate quality of the clustering models. I have implemented this as part of my reasearch based on the methods from several publications (can be found below). Please note that I do not guarantee the computation performanc or the correctness of the implementation. 

# Cluster Performance Evaluation Measures
These include the following

- **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) score**: An implementation of the algorithm from Hubert L, Arabie P. Comparing partitions. J Classification.
1985 Dec;2(1):193–218. 
- **Silhouette score**: Rousseeuw PJ. Silhouettes: a graphical aid to the interpretation and validation of cluster analysis. J Comput Appl Math. 1987;20:53–65.
- **Information Criterias** consisting of Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) and ICL. An implementation of the algorithms from Goutte C, Hansen LK, Liptrot MG, et al. Feature-space clustering for fMRI meta-analysis. Hum Brain Mapp. 2001 Jul;13(3):165–183.
- **Prediction Strength**: An implementation of the algorithm from Tibshirani R, Walther G. Cluster validation by prediction strength. J Comput Graph Stat. 2005;14(3):511-528.
